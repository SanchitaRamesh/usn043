i wish i was there with you and played with you....
you really are an intresting person ...
in fact my inspiration...... :-)
i used to read your diary ...
also diary's of you parents and grand parents.....
sometimes i am lost i thoughts about ..."how i wish the romanoves lived...how i wish alexie became the tsar...what kind of tsar would alexie be...."
unfortunately.....everything can only be dreamt...as you can never come back alive.... :-(
